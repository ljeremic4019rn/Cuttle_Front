        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters" style="font-size: 25px"> Goal - </span> the goal is to be the first to accumulate 21 or more points worth of point cards on your
            side of the table. The first player to achieve this wins the game.</p>

        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters " style="font-size: 25px"> Play - </span> On your turn you must perform exactly one of the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw a card from the draw pile and add it to your hand</li>
            <li>Play a point card from your hand</li>
            <li>Play a one-off effect card from your hand</li>
            <li>Play a permanent effect card from your hand</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Card types and how to use them</h2>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 1. Point cards - </span> Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 can be played as point cards.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 2. One-off effect cards - </span> Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 can be played as one-off effect cards.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 3. Permanent effect cards - </span> 8, Jack, Queen, King can be played as permanent effect cards</p>

        <h2> One-off Effects</h2>

        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> Ace - </span> Scrap all point cards on the table - both yours and your opponents.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 2 - </span> Play a two in your turn to scrap any permanent effect card on the table OR Play a two to block a one-off effect card played by your opponent. </p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 3 - </span> Rummage through the scrap pile and add a card of your choice to your hand. Since the 3 is not scrapped until after its effect has been carried out, you cannot use this effect to take back the 3 you just played.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 4 - </span> Your opponent must discard two cards of his choice from his hand, showing them to you before placing them on the scrap pile.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 5 - </span> Draw the top two cards from the draw pile and add them to your hand.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 6 - </span> Scrap all permanent effect cards on the table - both yours and your opponents.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 7 - </span> Draw a card and play it immediately however you wish.
            If you draw a card that cannot be played immediately it is discarded, but if it can be played you must play it, even if it is to your disadvantage. For example a jack might have to be used to give a point card to your opponent.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 9 - </span> Return any one permanent effect card on the table to its controllerâ€™s hand.
            Note that if you use this to return a jack, the point card that it was stacked on changes sides.</p>

        <h2> Permanent Effects</h2>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> 8 - </span> While you have an 8 on the table as a permanent effect card, your opponent must play with the cards in his hand exposed. The 8 is placed sideways on the table, distinguishing it from point cards and making it look like a pair of glasses.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> Jack -</span> Transfer control of a point card. The jack is placed on top of a point card and both cards are moved across the table, changing the owner. Multiple jacks can be stacked.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> Queen -</span> All your point cards and permanent effect cards on the table other than queens are defended from effects that target single cards. Queens protect against 2, 9 and jack effects.</p>
        <p class="yellow-text"><span class="big-letters"> King - </span> The number of points you require to win the game is reduced according to the number of kings on your side of the table as follows: 0K-21p | 1K-14p | 2K-10p | 3K-7p | 4K-5p</p>
